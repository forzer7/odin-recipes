            <h4>Recipe instructions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Marinate:</b> Mix together all of the ingredients besides the chicken. Place chicken in a bowl or large ziplock bag. Add the marinade to the chicken and toss to coat. Cover the bowl or seal the ziplock bag and place it in the fridge to marinate for 1 hour.</li>
                <li><b>Prep the Oven and Pan:</b> When you&#39;re ready to cook, preheat the oven to 375°F. Place the chicken breast, bone side down, on a baking pan.</li>
                <li><b>Prep the Chicken:</b>Spoon a little extra marinade on top of each piece of chicken and then toss the remaining marinade. Sprinkle the chicken with a bit more Italian seasoning, salt and pepper.</li>
                <li><b>Bake:</b>Bake the chicken in the preheated oven until the chicken meat is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear. This should take about 45 to 55 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the breast meat should read 165°F.</li>
                <li><b>Rest and Serve:</b> Cover the chicken loosely with foil and allow it to rest for 5 minutes, then serve. This ensures your chicken stays extra juicy.</li>
            </ol>
