                <li>Prepare macaroni noodles according to package instructions. Drain and rinse immediately with cold water, then drizzle with a teaspoon of olive oil and gently stir so the noodles don't stick together as they sit.</li>

                <li>To prepare your macaroni salad dressing, combine mayonnaise, sour cream, red wine vinegar, sweet pickle juice, sugar, dijon mustard, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and crushed red pepper (if using) in a medium-sized bowl. Whisk until ingredients are well-combined.</li>
                <li>Pour dressing over your macaroni salad ingredients and toss until well-combined.</li>
                <li>For best flavor, cover bowl and allow macaroni salad to chill for at least one hour. Stir once more before serving and enjoy!</li>
